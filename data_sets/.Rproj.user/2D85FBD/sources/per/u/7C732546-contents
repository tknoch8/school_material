library(here)

# now I can call any file from within the directory

# for example
mydata <- read.csv(here("bears.csv"))
mydata

# way easier than typing the whole fucking file path, and you can send it to other people
  # and it works for them too, because it's all in the project's folder. They just need to
  # open the .Rproj file.
