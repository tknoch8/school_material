summary(PCA)

## PCA is a dimension reduction technique, used when variables are
# correlated

## Principal components account for most of the variance of observed variables

(fac.loads <- round(cor(std.data, PCA$x), 2)) ## "importance" of each variable in
# determining PCs

plot(PCA) ## keep two (first two account for ~55% of variability)

## (next) obtain first two eigenvectors to get linear combinations of Y's
# that go into first two PCAs

### Now transition to Factor Analysis ###

(a_rm <- round(PCA$rotation %*% diag(PCA$sdev)[,1:4], 2)) ## unrotated factor loadings

round(diag(a_rm %*% t(a_rm)), 2) ## proportions of variability attributable
# to common factors, across observations (communalities)

## lots of overlap in factors across variables
# 6/9 variables are related to two or more common factors

## must rotate factors using Varimax rotation, maximizing
# the sum of these variances (factor loadings)^2 for all of the factors and
# breaks overlap.

# "verimax rotation"

(rot <- varimax(a_rm, eps = 1e-12)$rotmat)

round(t(rot)%*%rot) ## Demonstrate orthogonality for orthogonal rotation
round(rot%*%t(rot))

(g_rm <- round(a_rm %*% rot, 2)) ## New (rotated) factor loadings

a_rm
g_rm ## eliminated most of the overlap by orthogonal rotation

## (reminder): number of factors kept is number of 
# sds (sqrt(eigenvalues)) > 1 in PCs
PCA

round(diag(g_rm %*% t(g_rm)), 2)
round(diag(a_rm %*% t(a_rm)), 2) ## communalities are unchanged* by rotation

(Fstar <- round(std.data %*% g_rm %*% solve(t(g_rm) %*% g_rm), 2))

subset(countryloads, Country == "Albania"); subset(euroemp, Country == "Albania")

## Factor 1 is largely determined by presence of AGR and absence of SPS. 
# Albania has a high percentage of labor employed in AGR and zero labor
# employed in SPS. Makes sense that Albania has a high Factor 1 score.
